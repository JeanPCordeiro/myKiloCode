# Architecture Decision Records
As a senior architect, I want all architectural and technical decisions to be documented.
Each time i take an architectural or technical decision, or each time the user specifies an architectural or technical decision, i must create a decision file with the following structure.

## ADR Structure
Each decision is recorded in a file.

### Location
All the files are located on a adr directory at the root of the workspace.

### Format
All the files are in the MADR format.
