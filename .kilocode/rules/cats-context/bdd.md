# BDD 
As a team composed of a senior architect, a business analyst, a technical manager, and a test manager,
I want, during the design phase, that all functional descriptions of the project to be written in the form of scenarios described in Gherkin,
and I want these scenarios to be derived from a BDD Tres Amigos approach.

## BDD Structure
The scenarios are grouped by themes.

### Location
Each theme file is located on a features directory at the root of the workspace.

### Format
All the files are in the gerkin format with examples
