# Project Brief

This document serves as the foundational brief for the project. It outlines the core requirements, goals, and overall scope.

## Core Requirements:
- All architectural and technical decisions must be documented in ADR files in the `adr` directory, following the MADR format.
- All backend services must be built using Express.js.
- All functional descriptions must be written as Gherkin scenarios in the `features` directory, grouped by themes, and derived from a BDD Tres Amigos approach.
- All project modeling must be done in C4 Mermaid on all four levels, with each level recorded in a file in the `modelisation` directory.
- All frontend applications must be JavaScript SPAs.

## Goals:
- To establish a clear and consistent documentation standard for architectural decisions, functional requirements, and system modeling.
- To ensure maintainability and scalability of the codebase through adherence to specified backend and frontend patterns.
- To facilitate collaboration and understanding among team members (senior architect, business analyst, technical manager, test manager) through structured documentation.

## Scope:
- This project focuses on setting up the foundational rules and documentation standards for future development.
- It includes defining the structure for ADRs, BDD features, C4 models, and specifying technology choices for frontend and backend.
