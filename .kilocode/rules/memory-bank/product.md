# Product Description

## Why this project exists
This project exists to establish a robust and consistent framework for software development, ensuring high standards in documentation, architecture, and functional specification. It aims to streamline future development efforts by providing clear guidelines and a single source of truth for project information.

## Problems it solves
- Inconsistent documentation practices
- Lack of clear architectural guidelines
- Disjointed functional specifications
- Difficulty in onboarding new team members due to scattered information

## How it should work
The project should work by providing a centralized "Memory Bank" of documentation, including:
- Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for technical decisions.
- Gherkin scenarios for functional requirements.
- C4 models for system architecture visualization.
- Clear definitions of frontend and backend technology choices.

## User experience goals
- Developers can quickly find and understand project information.
- Architects can easily document and communicate design decisions.
- Business analysts and test managers have clear, structured functional specifications.
- New team members can rapidly get up to speed on project conventions and history.
